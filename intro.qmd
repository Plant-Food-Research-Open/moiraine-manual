# Introduction

```{r}
#| child: "_setup.qmd"
```

-   omics dataset + what are samples and features metadata

-   what is multi-omics integration

-   supervised vs unsupervised

-   the analysis workflow from moiraine (use the graph I use in presentations)

### Other things to add in intro

Note: Throughout the package and vignettes, we refer to the different biological entities measured in a given dataset (e.g. genes, transcripts, metabolic compounds, etc) as features.


To improve upon the default ggplot2 colours, each vignette is run with the following options:

```{r ggplo2-colour-options}
#| eval: false
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis",
  ggplot2.discrete.colour = function() {
    ggplot2::scale_colour_brewer(
      palette = "Paired", 
      na.value = "grey"
    )
  } ,
  ggplot2.discrete.fill = function() {
    ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(
      palette = "Paired",
      na.value = "grey"
    )
  } 
)
```
