    "text": "The dataset that is used as example in this manual comes from Li et al. (2022). In this paper, the authors investigate the molecular mechanisms of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in beef cattle, using multi-omics data. They collected genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics measurements on blood samples obtained from both healthy and infected animals. They performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic variants associated with BRD incidence, as well as a differential expression (DE) analysis on both the transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets to identify genes and metabolites whose expression or abundance differed between the two animal groups. They also performed an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to highlight associations between genomic variants and differentially expressed genes. The datasets analysed in this article are publicly available. In this chapter, we detail the content of each dataset, and how they were obtained and processed to use for this manual.\n\n\n\n\nLi, Jiyuan, Robert Mukiibi, Janelle Jiminez, Zhiquan Wang, Everestus C.
